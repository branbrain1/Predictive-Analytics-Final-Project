# Traffic-Volume-Prediction
#### The objective of this project was to develop a predictive model that can identify the traffic volume based on holidays and weather.
#### The model should enable proactive maintenance before possible traffic congestion.
## Data Source
#### The original data set data was pulled from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository and can be downloaded directly here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/492/metro+interstate+traffic+volume
## Instalation
#### Code for installing the required packages for running the codes are included in the files. You will need to have python installed to run the code files on your system.
#### There are four commit files, one for each model that we explored.

## Usage
#### Clone the repository to your local machine:
#### git clone https://github.com/your-username/traffic-volume-prediction.git

#### Navigate to the project directory:
#### cd traffic-volume-prediction
#### Run the Jupyter Notebook file:
#### jupyter notebook
#### Open the notebooks and execute the code cells to explore the codes. Thank you!
