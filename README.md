# Traffic-Volume-Prediction
#### The objective of this project was to develop a predictive model that can identify the traffic volume based on holidays and weather.
#### The model should enable proactive maintenance before possible traffic congestion.
## Data Source
#### The original data set data was pulled from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository and can be downloaded directly here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/492/metro+interstate+traffic+volume
## Instalation
#### Code for installing the required packages for running the codes are included in the files. You will need to have python installed to run the code files on your system.
#### There are three commit files on total for the models that we explored.

## Usage
#### Each of us named the original CSV file something different when we started our individual analysis. We submitted out original CSV file for the project in a zip folder. Simply change the name of the file in the code to read to data. 
#### For LSTM: og_data.csv
#### For AR 1 & ARIMA: Metro_Interstate_Traffic_Volume.csv
#### For SARIMAX: The Original source data was updated before being read into code. Please use the CSV file titled grouped_records.csv which is included in the submitted zip folder and also linked here.
#### Clone the repository to your local machine:
#### git clone https://github.com/your-username/traffic-volume-prediction.git

#### Navigate to the project directory:
#### cd traffic-volume-prediction
#### Run the Jupyter Notebook file:
#### jupyter notebook
#### Open the notebooks and execute the code cells to explore the codes. Thank you!
